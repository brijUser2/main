    Move this to a "Notes.txt" in the archive 

    * Comb ALL plnks (chk log) for yr 
      - poss overwrite ver.s 
      - ensure all exist in git (d3?)
      Use <a href='https://trivedienterprisesinc.github.io/brijLog24.html'>this</a> as a starting pt.
      - For non-incl months, choose 3ish (10th, 20th, eom) or ea wk
      - ENSURE all backup plnks are covered.  If necc rename/resetup standalone vers.
      - Jan thru Sept was mostly gfx work; some copies exist in repo

      The idea is to avoid losing stuff (will lose diffs anyway); take wkly snapshots (incl rename dupes) and collect in a separate fork.
